# GDCMatcher-Python
Implementation of a prototype for the Game Developer Contract Matcher case study application. This provides a somewhat fuller version of a text-based menu UI implementation and a cutdown version implemented as a Tkinter GUI application (only allows creating/reading/deleting of clients/contactors/contracts).
